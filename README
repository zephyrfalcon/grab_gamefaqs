A simple, quick & dirty script, written in old-school Python, to grab the FAQs
of a particular game off of GameFAQs.
.

--->
NOTE [2011-04-16]: Apparently there is now a new FAQ format, using HTML for
formatting (as opposed to the old FAQs, which always were plain text). This
script does not support the new format yet.

Example:
formatted with pagination:
http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/989552-pokemon-black-version/faqs/62028
fixed-width printable (still has some formatting):
http://www.gamefaqs.com/ds/989552-pokemon-black-version/faqs/62028?print=2
<---


REQUIREMENTS:

- Python 2.6, but older versions of Python will probably work as well. (The
  current version of the script will NOT work with Python 3.x.)


HOW TO USE:


.(1).  Go to the FAQs page for a particular game, and copy the URL.

For example: [http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/564920-loom/faqs]


.(2).  Feed this URL to grab_gamefaqs.py, and specify an output directory:

  $ python grab_gamefaqs.py http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/564920-loom/faqs loom


.(3).  That's it! All the FAQs found on the given page should now be written to
       the output directory, retaining their original names.
