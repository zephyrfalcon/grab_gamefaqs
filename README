# grab_gamefaqs                     

.
A simple, quick & dirty script, written in old-school Python, to grab the FAQs
of a particular game off of GameFAQs.
.


REQUIREMENTS:

- Python 2.7, but older versions of Python will probably work as well. (The
  current version of the script will NOT work with Python 3.x.)


HOW TO USE:


.(1).  Go to the FAQs page for a particular game, and copy the URL.

For example: [http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/564920-loom/faqs]


.(2).  Feed this URL to grab_gamefaqs.py, and specify an output directory:

  $ python grab_gamefaqs.py http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/564920-loom/faqs loom


.(3).  That's it! All the FAQs found on the given page should now be written to
       the output directory, retaining their original names.


Note that some FAQs are *BIG*, and may require a minute or two to download,
especially on slower connections.

Also: kindly do not abuse this script. It is meant as a handy program to
quickly get all of a game's FAQs at once, not as a tool to scrape the whole
GameFAQs site.


UPDATE (version 1.2, 2015-05-24):

It seems this script no longer worked properly. I fixed the detection and
extraction of plain text files and images, and added support for custom
user-agents.
